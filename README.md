## java-tutorials
In this repository, you may find beginner-friendly tutorials about abstract coding concepts, which I try to explain in a comprehensive manner.
I am a person whose way to wrap my head around things is to by looking at them in a visual way, and by using analogies and metaphors.

On the one hand, I find it is easier to understand and internalize these concepts by writing them down and explain them to myself in a way I can understand, sometimes highly simplified.
On the other hand, I am a helpful person and know very well how hard it can often be to find helpful information.

The last, but not less important, reason for my tutorials is that I simply tend to forget concept. Especially when I haven't used them for a while. Through this repository, I create an additional source of reference to my private reference books. Instead of only writing down plane theory or summarize it, I put more fantasy and creativity into it.

Now it's your turn:<br>
If you find something in my tutorials that is not comprehensible to you, just open a new issue and write me. 
I really appreciate constructive feedback to make my tutorials even more understandable and accessible - because there are already enough tutorials out there that are hard to understand.
