"Why can't I just use == and != to compare refercence types like String?"

How I understand this:

The reference or address just tells Java where to look in Heap memory for the value.
Think of it like having a cooking book. 
If you know the page number for the recipe of your favorite dish - well this is the reference/address.
But knowing the actually recipe with all its ingredients, steps to follow, tools need and so on, that's a whole different thing.

While you can compare that your favorite dish and mine are both will be found on page 42 by using == or !=, 
you can not compare the actual dishes by this. Yours could be "Steak and Potatoes" while mine could be "Fish and Rice".

Sticking to the cooking book example, you can imagine Stack memory like the table of contend on the first couple of pages of the book.
Simple info, nothing special, and so Integers / Primitives are.
They don't need much, therefore they just can stay inside Stack memory and just can be copied if needed.

I hope this kind of illustrated explanation helps you to wrap your head around it 😊

Cheers
